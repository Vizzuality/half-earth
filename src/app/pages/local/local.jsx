        In September 2013, we embarked on our most challenging crossing of the
        Okavango Delta… The research data set we achieved over 15 days and 338km
        using a bespoke Android App was the most comprehensive ever and was
        shared in real-time via an open API and up-to-date satellite image. This
        10-minute video documents an impossible expedition across dry, abandoned
        floodplains and crocodile- and hippopotamus-infested channels flanked by
        the abundance of life. Astonishingly, red lechwe, an aquatic antelope
        only found in the Okavango Delta, were the second most frequently
        sighted after squacco herons and African jacanas, the most abundant
        wetland birds in the region. Thousands of buffalo, giraffe, zebra,
        tsetsebe, kudu, elephant, baboon, lion, hyena, wild dog and much else
        gathered on the islands nearby the last flowing channels in the central
        wilderness of Africa’s last-remaining wetland wilderness.
