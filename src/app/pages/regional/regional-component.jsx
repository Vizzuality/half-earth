          Soaring high up upon the air thermals, white storks glide alongside
          millions of other birds that make the journey between Europe, Africa
          and back each year. Many of these species have been observed, tagged
          and mapped. Passing over Zimbabwe, the birds fan out towards Botswana,
          Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Lesotho and South Africa, down to the
          Cape Region. The Cape Regionis is one of the most biologically diverse
          regions on Earth and is characterised by its{' '}

          Half-Earth integrates historical and current distribution data with
          the analysis of protected area governance and management to inform
          decision-making and provide scientific leadership on which areas must
          be protected. Our map of the Cape Region area highlights where the
          greatest concentration of life can be found and the threats they face.

          We currently have detailed information for just a fraction of our
          planet, yet itâ€™s within our ability and reach to apply this mapping
          approach to every part of the world. By combining all the knowledge we

          how.
